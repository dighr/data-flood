# Natural Language Processing for Humanitarian Survey Work
### Challenge presented by International Rescue Committee

The International Rescue Committee (IRC) presented its challenge on the lack of qualitative methods in humanitarian surveys at the 2018 Emergency Data Science Workshop. They posed the question to workshop attendees if there are ways to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate transcription, translation, and analysis of open-ended responses to various types of humanitarian data collection methods.

Immediately following the EDS 2018 Workshop, the Dahdaleh Institute convened a day-long meeting with a smaller working group. The team has since begun building the required transcription and translation models and identifying sites for a pilot project.
