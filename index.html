                                <p>An invite-only international workshop hosted by the Dahdaleh Institute for Global Health Research (DIGHR) and the Lassonde School of Engineering (LSE) at York University that brings together leading humanitarian agencies, data scientists, and developers to collaborate on urgent data-related challenges in humanitarian response.</p>

                                <a class="image main"><img src="{{ "/images/picture2.jpeg" | absolute_url }}" alt="Challenge" /></a>
                                <p>Humanitarian responders are producing or have access to ever more data in our operational sphere. The question we now face is how can we use this data to improve decision-making in humanitarian response? In this workshop, we will bring together humanitarian organizations, data scientists, and developers to collaborate on a number of specific field-driven challenges that require novel data science-driven solutions.</p>
