# Taking Advantage of Cash Delivery Data

### Challenge presented by Catholic Relief Services

Catholic Relief Services’ challenge focused on how we can improve cash- and market-based programming in humanitarian crises though more objective, timely, and automated response analysis that leverages new Big Data capabilities. They wanted to generate a more objective response analysis at the beginning of new humanitarian crisis, and limit human intervention in the decision of funding of the intervention, intervention strategy and response options, including delivery mechanism.
