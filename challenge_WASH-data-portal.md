# WASH Data Portal

### Challenge presented by UNHCR & REACH

*Note: This is a joint challenge with two use cases from UNHCR (global) and REACH (South Sudan specific).*

## Context
At the 2018 Emergency Data Science Workshop, the Office of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and the REACH Initiative presented a joint challenge. The UNHCR was looking to develop a WASH Data Portal that would be a “one stop shop” for information about WASH service access for refugees and IDPs globally. REACH was aiming to develop a WASH Information Management (IM) Platform, specifically for South Sudan.

<blockquote>
"The [EDS Workshop] session gave us a viable methodology for incrementally developing the WASH Data Portal and gave us the confidence that it was a challenge we could overcome."<br>

### What Happened Next
Guided by the agile development methodology presented at the 2018 EDS Workshop, UNHCR has built and is refining a new WASH Dashboard for Refugee Settings, which is now live on the web and being positively utilized by UNHCR Country Programs.
